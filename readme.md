# Lights Out - Vue.js Game

A simple implementation of the classic **Lights Out** puzzle game built with Vue.js. Tap the grid lights to toggle them and their neighbors. The goal is to turn **all lights off**.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- You are presented with a 3x3 grid of lights (on or off).
- Clicking (or tapping) a light toggles it and any adjacent lights (up, down, left, right).
- Your objective is to turn **all the lights off**.
- You win if all lights are off, and lose if all are on again.

## ðŸ§  Game Logic

The grid is represented as a flat array of 9 elements (`lightStatus`).
Each index has a predefined relationship mapping to its neighbors:

```js
relations = {
  0: [1,3],
  1: [0,2,4],
  2: [1,5],
  ...
}
```
